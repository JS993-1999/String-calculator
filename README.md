# String-calculator

For this function, no importing of libraries is required.
1. The program can take negative numbers and account for _ by taking it as a negative sign.
2. Number cannot be greater than 100000000 at any point of the calculation, and it will treat as an error. That is, it will completely stop the execution of code any further.
3. The code can realize ( and ).
4. String of calculations can be entered into the function repeatedly. This can be done by having the calculations in a list and then applying a for loop for taking an individual string of input at a time.

## functions

1. stringProcessing() is to convert the strings that may have spaces, and other variations can be transformed into a general string format for further processing.

2. operator() is for the calculations and giving respective outputs.

3. checkappend() is for checking if the number size has not exceeded more than 10,000,000. Elsewise, it will be treated as an error and terminate the execution of the code.

4. calculation() is the function where all the functions are assembled to make the calculation, and output is obtained.

## task that could not be implemented
The termination of the program on pressing Esc or 0 was not possible. I tried installing and importing the keyboard library for implementation. But the results obtained were not satisfactory. And so, I decided to remove it from the final draft.
